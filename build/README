Typical "cmake" commands, for lazy copy/paster (recommended: option 2):

 (1) cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install ../src
 (2) cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../src
 (3) cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_CXX11=ON ../src

Option 1 configures AERIE in "Debug" mode, which turns on debugging symbols and
disables compiler optimization.  It will compile quickly but run slowly.  This
is recommended for developers.

Options 2 and 3 will configure AERIE in "Release" mode, which turns off
all debugging and enables the highest level of compiler optimization that is
still compatible with strict C/C++ language standards.  Option 3 will
additionally compile with support for C++11 language features (WARNING: results
will vary depending on your compiler).

For MacOS:
On more recent MacOS versions, produces a lot of warning, which can be suppressed using these flags: -Wno-dev -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-Wl" -DCMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS="-Wl"

After all changes type:
cd $HAWC_BUILD
make -j 4 install
