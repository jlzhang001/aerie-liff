CR: I moved all the 3ML "examples" to 3ml/untested on 2017-05-22.

I'll test some and move them to 3ml/tested, and add a description in the README
there.

It would be great if we could differentiate the examples from the other things
there, a lot of scripts look very specific to a particular analysis and probably
belong here.
