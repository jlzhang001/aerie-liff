List of examples:
- fitPoint.py:
    Fit a point source with a simple power law energy spectrum.
    There is an option to write the model file, which is a a ROOT file
    containing a maptree containing with the fitted sources (to be used with
    LiFF to subtract a source).
- fitMorphology.py:
    Fit a source with a simple power law energy spectrum, using either a point
    source, a disk, a Gauss or a diffusion model. The further down this
    morphology list the slower. Also, free index is slower than fixed. Can run
    MCMC to find parameter space and plot it.
- testCrab3ML.py:
    Fit a log-parabola spectrum, run MCMC to find the parameter space, plot it.
