# Introduction to LiFF #
########################

This project is the Likelihood Fitting Framework (LiFF), a software 
designed to analyze event map data from the HAWC Observatory 
( http://hawc-observatory.org ) by fitting
spatial and spectral parameters of sources using a maximum likelihood
technique.

The software is a collaborative effort of many members of
the HAWC Collaboration. 

The project is led and maintained by:
+ Robert Lauer <rlauer@phys.unm.edu>

Key developers include:
+ Patrick Younk <pwyounk@gmail.com>
+ Giacomo Vianello <giacomo.slac@gmail.com>
+ Hao Zhou <hzhou1@mtu.edu>
+ J. Patrick Harding <jpharding@lanl.gov>
+ Colas Riviere <riviere@umdgrb.umd.edu>

Installation
------------

LIFF is distributed as the liff-project within aerie. All LIFF software 
compiles with aerie. 
AERIE_-_Analysis_and_Event_Reconstruction_Integrated_Environment

A description of the software has been published in 
Proceedings of Science and is available on arXiv:
https://pos.sissa.it/archive/conferences/236/948/ICRC2015_948.pdf
https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07479


Examples
--------

There are examples provided in liff. Once aerie has been installed, they can be run anywhere with 
an aerie environment. All of these executables also are configurable in the 
command-line (run with -h for help on parameters) to run them on other data or
with different settings:

liff-HealpixSigFluxMap      
   - create a map of significnces and fluxes for a region

The source code for all these examples is well commented and can be found under:
$HAWC_SRC/liff/examples
