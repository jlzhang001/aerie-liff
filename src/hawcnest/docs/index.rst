HAWCNest
========

HAWCNest is a software **framework** intended for processing of HAWC events
(simulated and measured), and also provides a platform for subsequent data
analysis.  Its role is to provide physicists with a uniform and coherent way to
"plug in" their reconstruction and analysis code and make it usable by others.
The code is broken down into discrete components that are added to the
framework separately and in a regularized way.

The details of HAWCNest can be found in an online technical document
[Pre2010]_, which is summarized in the sections below.
