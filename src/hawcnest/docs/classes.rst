HAWCNest Classes
================

The AERIE event processing model is implemented in several classes in the
`hawcnest <../../doxygen/html/group__hawcnest__api.html>`_ project:
:ref:`hawcnest_bag` to store event data, :ref:`hawcnest_modules` to generate
and process data, and :ref:`hawcnest_loops` to step through events.
