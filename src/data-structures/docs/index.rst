Data Structures
===============

The data structures project contains a set of utility classes that represent
the most common data types used in calculations and AERIE modules.  These
include classes to represent geometric types such as vectors and tranformation
matrices, representations of time in various systems, detector and event data,
etc.

Along with the :ref:`hawcnest` project, the data structures are a dependency
of all other projects in AERIE.
