GRModel Services
================

The grmodel-services project contains functions used to model cosmic-ray and
gamma-ray sources. Included in the project are:

* Classes to model isotropic and anisotropic cosmic-ray backgrounds;
* Classes to model point-like and extended emission;
* Classes to calculate attenuation of gamma rays by extragalactic background light;
* Configuration files containing various cosmic-ray and gamma-ray data sets.
